Hmmm....
Okay..
So..
I tried my best then I cried.

So today I had a quiz this morning using Express, EJS, Sequelize, and PG. But I failed to make the database.
From Task 0, I already went wrong. I didn't read the rules.

Anyway, I tried to do Friday task using Express, EJS, Sequelize, and PG. And I can make the database. 
Same step, same concept but different task and different result.
Where do I go wrong? 

So, that's that. Good is good. Good luck for tommorow code challenge!

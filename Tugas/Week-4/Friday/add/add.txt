Hmmm....
Okay..

So today I had a quiz this morning using Express, EJS, Sequelize, and PG. And I failed to make the database.
I didn't read the rules an everything went down.

Anyway, I tried to do Friday task using Express, EJS, Sequelize, and PG. And I can make the database. 
Same step, same concept but different task and different result.
Where do I go wrong? 

So, that's that. Good is good. Good luck for tommorow code challenge!

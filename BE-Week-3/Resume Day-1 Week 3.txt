What I learn today?
1. Variable using let & const
'let' and 'const' are different from 'var'. 
When you use 'var' to declare something, you can redeclare it 
again. But, it's not the same with 'let' and 'const'. 'let' 
and 'const' are mutable or modify only for objects and array. 
The difference between 'let' and 'const' is  you can change 
the value of 'let' but not for 'const'.

2. Arrow Function
Shorthand for function to make it simpler.

3. A bit about Import and Export
Exporting and importing files from outside the files

4. Basic of Class
Class is a function with to main components, expressions and 
declaration. In the Class, there is function constructor to 
point out the parameters or to declare the variable.
You can say, Class is a blueprint for the app.
